# Chess game for exam
A chess game.
Interface language is in Norwegian.
Most rules work and are implemented in code, with some small exceptions.

Missing rules/functionality:
The game can't see if a king is in a checkmate
The game doesn't explicitly declare a winner, the players decide when to end the game
Some other small bugs/missing rules
