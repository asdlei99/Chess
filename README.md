# Chess game for exam
A chess game.
Interface language is in Norwegian.
Stockfish was used as this was a criteria for the exam, although we barely used Stockfish at all, we needed to provide atleast one instance where we used it. 
Most rules work and are implemented in code, with some small exceptions.

Missing rules/functionality:

The game doesn't check if either king is in a checkmate

The game doesn't explicitly declare a winner, the players decide when to end the game

Some other small bugs/missing rules

(FYI we got an A on this exam) :)
