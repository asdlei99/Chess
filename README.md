The Stockfish chess engine is implemented in the game as it was a criteria for the exam. Stockfish is used to analyze specific board setups inside our analyze mode.

The aesthetics were heavily inspired from online chess websites, such as [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/) and [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/home)

Most chess rules work and are implemented in code, with some small exceptions.

**We got an A on this exam :).**
